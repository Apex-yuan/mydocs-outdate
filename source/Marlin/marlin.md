Marlin is a huge C++ program composed of many files, but here we'll only be talking about the two files that contain all of Marlin's compile-time configuration options:

- `Configuration.h` contains the core settings for the hardware, language and controller selection, and settings for the most common features and components.
- `Configuration_adv.h` serves up more detailed customization options, add-ons, experimental features, and other esoterica.
